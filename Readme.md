## Applescript Codeless Language Module for TextWrangler ##

Modified version of the excellent Bill Hernandez CLM from [http://www.mail-archive.com/bbedit&#64;googlegroups.com/msg00548.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/bbedit%40googlegroups.com/msg00548.html) the link was [here](http://bbeditextras.org/wiki/index.php?title=Codeless_Language_Modules) at a wiki called _bbeditextras_. So __I started with the Hernandez version__. 

### WTF is here? ###

Since I'm __noob__ and forget what changes I made, I first commit the [Bill Hernandez](http://www.mail-archive.com/bbedit@googlegroups.com/msg00548.html) version, then __immediately__ commit my changed version. __Why?__ __So I can see WTF what I did__, I say. No one looks at changes anyway.

### What does it do? What's it all about? ###

Provide color syntax for AppleScript in TextWrangler, _and maybe BBEdit but I don't have BBEdit_. It also does...

More Colors
----------

I made _unorthodox_ use of the _Codeless Language Module's_ `BBLMPredefinedNameList` _Predefined names_ info [here](http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html) it says _as used in the Text Colors preferences_. __more colors!__ Obligatory code example.

``` xml
<!-- Testing use of this symbol -->
<key>BBLMPredefinedNameList</key>
<array>
	<string>alias</string>
	<string>at</string>
   <!-- and so on -->
	<string>typefaces</string>
	<string>with</string>
</array>
```

## Installation ##

Likely, no one will see this stuff, so installation is not an issue. But if I forget, maybe I'll put that info here, or a link to it. Yes a link would be better. No wait, it's faster to Google it than to waste time adding to this readme file.


If you stumbled here (eg. mistyped URL) do know: 
-----------------------------------------------

1.  These things I read on internets &amp; added to scripts haphazardly.
    I can not guarantee anything. "As-Is".

3.  I know nothing about licenses. Whatever license(s) these files are supposed to be, they are.

5.  Whatever credits or clauses should be here, is temporary error of stupidity and poor memory.

7.  Dot files rule, bigger is better.

9.  Readme files, not a fan.
