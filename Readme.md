## Applescript Codeless Language Module for TextWrangler ##

Modified version of the excellent Bill Hernandez CLM from [http://www.mail-archive.com/bbedit&#64;googlegroups.com/msg00548.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/bbedit%40googlegroups.com/msg00548.html) the like was [here](http://bbeditextras.org/wiki/index.php?title=Codeless_Language_Modules) at a wiki called _bbeditextras_. So __I started with the Hernandez version__. 

### WTF is here? ###

Since I'm __noob__ and forget what changes I made, I first put the [Bill Hernandez](http://www.mail-archive.com/bbedit@googlegroups.com/msg00548.html) version here, then __immediately__ commit my changed version. __Why?__ __So I can see WTF what I did__, I say. No one looks at changes anyway.

More Colors
----------

I made _unorthodox_ use of the  Codeless Language Module `BBLMPredefinedNameList` _Predefined names_ info [here](http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html) it says _as used in the Text Colors preferences_. __more colors!__ Obligatory code example.

``` plist
<!-- Testing use of this symbol: -->
<key>BBLMPredefinedNameList</key>
<array>
	<string>alias</string>
	<string>at</string>
   <!-- and so on -->
	<string>typefaces</string>
	<string>with</string>
</array>
```

If you stumbled here (eg. mistyped URL) do know: 
-----------------------------------------------

1.  These things I read on internets &amp; added to scripts haphazardly.
    I can not guarantee anything. "As-Is".

3.  I know nothing about licenses. Whatever license(s) these files are supposed to be, they are.

5.  Whatever credits or clauses should be here, is temporary error of stupidity and poor memory.

7.  Dot files rule, bigger is better.

9.  Readme files, not a fan.
